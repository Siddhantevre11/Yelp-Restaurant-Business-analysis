# Yelp-Restaurant-Business-Analysis

Using restaurant business reviews on Yelp, we build a system for both users and restaurants where restaurants can gain insights about their customers and services and customers can gain the benefit of recommended businesses using Unsupervised Learning techniques.

We use clustering techniques like K means and GMM to find the top food cuisines enjoyed by customers.

We used various Topic modeling techniques such as LDA, LSA, and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization to allow businesses to gain information about their weak spots in businesses such as High wait time, food quality, etc.

We used Collaborative and Text-based Recommender systems to help users identify more likable restaurant places based on similar user ratings and required attributes provided by the users. 

Do look at the Restaurant_Business_Analysis_and_Optimization ppt for results on each topic and the Restaurant_Business_Analysis_and_Optimization_Report file for a written report explaining all findings.
